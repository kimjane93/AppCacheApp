# App Cache App

## Getting Started

Welcome to the [App Cache](https://appcache-x.herokuapp.com/)! This app came into existence ironically due to my inability to decide on a build idea. I wanted a place where I could create and store app ideas I wanted to work on, and also look at other build ideas my peers had thought of and/or implemented. 
Going out into the world as a developer baby fresh off the coding bootcamp train, I built this app to hold myself accountable, and to promote networking and connection building amongst my fellow coding peers.

## Icebox Goals
* I want to implement private messaging to increase the engagement between users
* I want to build out the email functionality, to either between users or create mailing lists
* I want to be able to search users
* I want to add in a build-status model that upon a user adding an app to their collection, they are associated with a build status that they can toggle between built and not built for that particular app
* I want to generate a random app for user inspiration
* I want to implement AWS Buckets to allow image file uploads for profile photos
